#### TMDb Movies ####

Today we will be analyzing the TMDb data set from Kaggle. This data set has almost 11,000 movie entries that include the movie's title, budget, revenue, ratings and many other columns with detialed information. We will assess the data, clean, format it and analyze it.


Questions to answer:

- What are the most popular genre in the dataframe?
- Do films with higher voting counts have a higher profit?
- What is the average runtime?
- Is runtime associated with higher profits?
- Which movies generated the most/least profit?
